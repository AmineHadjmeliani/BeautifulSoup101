Web Scraping Using beautifulsoup 

BeautifulSoup is a powerful library for web scraping in Python. It allows you to easily navigate, search, and modify the elements of an HTML or XML document. Here is a tutorial that covers the basics of using BeautifulSoup:

* Installation: You can install BeautifulSoup using pip by running pip install beautifulsoup4.

* Importing the library: To use `BeautifulSoup`, you need to import it first by writing from `bs4` import `BeautifulSoup`

* Parsing an HTML or XML document: To parse an HTML or XML document, you need to pass it to the BeautifulSoup constructor along with the parser you want to use.

* Navigating the tree structure: Once you have a BeautifulSoup object, you can navigate through the elements in the document using various methods such as `find()`, `find_all()`, `select()` and `select_one()`

* Searching for elements: BeautifulSoup provides a variety of methods for searching for elements in the document, such as `find()`, `find_all()`, `select()` and `select_one()`. These methods allow you to search for elements by tag name, CSS class, and other attributes.

* Modifying elements: You can also use BeautifulSoup to modify the elements in the document by adding, deleting, or changing the elements' attributes.

* Extracting data: Once you have located the elements you want to extract data from, you can use the .text property to extract the text content of the elements.
